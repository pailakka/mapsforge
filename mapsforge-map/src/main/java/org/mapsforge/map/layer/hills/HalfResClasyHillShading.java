/**
 * <p>
 * Half resolution implementation of {@link StandardClasyHillShading}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It reduces the number of pixels in the output bitmap and thus the memory used by a factor of 1/4 (1/2 in width and 1/2 in height).
 * This is done by skipping every second row and every second column in the input.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Main purpose is to improve performance and reduce memory use when the output bitmap is going to be down-scaled anyway,
 * for example when viewing a map on a low zoom level (very wide).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Standard 1" DEM file containing 1Â° square data will be processed to an output bitmap of about 1800x1800 px and 3.2 MB in size.
