/**
 * <p>
 * A standard implementation of the {@link AClasyHillShading}. Divides square unit elements into two triangles/planes
 * to calculate their average normal, which is then used to shade the unit element.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Horizontal surfaces, or all surfaces with slope less than {@code minSlope}, will have minimum shade.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Slopes are shaded linearly by default, i.e. main shade (shade before applying azimuthal asymmetry factor) is a linear function of slope, for performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For performance reasons, azimuthal asymmetry is also a linear function of the azimuth angle cosine.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Standard 1" DEM file containing 1Â° square data will be processed to an output bitmap of about 3600px by 3600px and 13 MB in size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is more accurate than {@link SimpleClasyHillShading}, and should be preferred.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * High resolution version is also available: {@link HiResClasyHillShading}.
 * It provides high quality output using bicubic interpolation, use it when you are not limited by memory or processing performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To greatly improve efficiency at wider zoom levels, you should consider using the adaptive quality version instead: {@link AdaptiveClasyHillShading}.
 * It provides the best results with excellent performance throughout the zoom level range.
